# Using the iAct app

The iAct course is being rolled out by [a few co-implementing partners](/contact) under the lead of ROCS to as many community schools in Zambia as possible. A core piece of this facilitation is a district representative who supports the education authorities at district and zonal level, so that the teachers (both volunteers and government-paid) in the targeted community schools receive tablets for the time of the course and are supervised.
However, tablets and smartphones are increasingly common and because the iAct course is an offline app (once it is downloaded to the device), bandwidth and connectivity costs don’t build a barrier to benefitting from the course as free user.

It is all about peer-to-peer learning! Building a group and arranging for regular meetings to jointly work on the weekly units is key. The learning impact of the iAct app basically depends on the intensity of working as a “community of practice”. For instance, really successful learning groups usually take videos from each other when practicing a certain method and then discuss this example in the group.

A typical way to make use of the iAct course would be a teacher in a public primary school, asking a few colleagues to build a learning group over 20 weeks (typically the first and second term) and organize this completely independently.

Another situation might be that a community school was part of the facilitated roll-out the year before, but new teachers (maybe together with some former iAct participants) in that school want to do the course, too. If someone has a tablet or a smartphone, a new round of the iAct course can take place and the zonal in-service coordinator is likely to be able to support, based on the experiences from the previous round.

# Install instructions

See below for the instructions on how to run the iAct app on your Lenovo tablet. For more information on installing the app, as well as setting up your tablet and performing software updates, [download the PDF installation manual](pdfs/iAct-installation-manual.pdf).


1. Insert a micro SD card with the folder *Videos*, which contains all 4+39 iAct videos (never change any names) and sub-folders with the application file (*iact.apk*), the pdf reader (*AdobeReader.apk*), the wallpaper file, the iAct logo and this set-up manual. Wait a few seconds, then swipe down from the top and look for the notification regarding the SD card. Tap *Set-Up*, select the first option (“use as portable storage”) and confirm with *Next* and *Done*. Swipe down from the top again and press *Clear All* to remove the SD-card notification. In any case, then go to *Settings*, select in the “Device” section *Storage* and *SD-card* (don’t hit “eject SD card), go to the folder *Videos* and *iAct* and press the iact.apk file to start the installation of the course app.

2. Before you can finish, you need to press *Settings* and switch on *Unknown Sources* (confirm with *OK*). After going back (triangle) and pressing the iact.apk again, the installation can be completed after reconfirming *Install*. Finish the installation by pressing *Done* (not *Open*).

3. Then press the AdobeReader.apk, press *Install* and finish installation again with *Done*. Finally, swipe down from the top and open *settings* (gear wheel) and in the “Personal” section *Security* and switch off *Unknown Sources*. Tap the *home button* (circle).

4. Go to the *all apps page* (grey round button) and move (by holding & dragging) the *iAct icon* through the grey area to the very bottom of the screen besides the camera icon.

5. Swipe down from the top, open Settings and the select in the “Device” section *Display*. Select *Wallpaper*, then *Wallpapers* (confirm: Allow access) and press *My Photos*.

6. If you don’t see the sources list, open it with the *menu* (three lines on the top). Select the *SD card* as source, to to the folder “Videos” and the sub-folder “iAct LenovoTab4”. Finally, select the file “LenovoTab4 iAct wallpaper” and confirm by *Set Wallpaper*.

7. Swipe down from the top and select the blue *user icon* on the top right. Then select *More Settings*, press the blue *Owner* icon on the top and overwrite the name with “iAct”. Then hold the blue *icon*, select *Gallery* and the folder “iAct LenovoTab4”, press the iAct logo and finish with *Done* and *Confirm*. Use *home button* to go back.

8. Go to *settings* again and select in the “System” section *About tablet* and then *Status*. Note down the tablet’s eight-digit serial number (the one after “SN:”) on a sticker on the tablet.

9. Swipe down from the top, open settings and the select in the “Device” section *Storage*. Select the *SD-card* and the folder *Videos* (you might need to press the three lines top-left first), press any video to start the video app for a first time. Confirm *Got it*, press somewhere on the video screen to show the context menu (three dots on the top right) and de-select *loop video*. Go back by home button.

10. Swipe down from the top to open *Settings* and the select in the “Device” section *Storage*. Select the *SD-card* (maybe you have to press the top left menu for this) and press the pdf-file in the folder “Lenovo Tab4” (the manual) to start the *AdobeAcrobat* app for a first time. Turn the tablet from portrait to landscape and back to check whether screen changes automatically. Go back with *home button*.

11. Finally, start the iAct app once, just to be sure that it works. You can open a module and a weekly unit, but if you move forward within that weekly unit (red dots), you need to go back to the first step before leaving.
