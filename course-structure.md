# Course content

The group-learning exercise facilitated by the iAct app emphasizes key methodologies which will make a difference in the classroom, particularly under difficult circumstances. Once inspired by the learned approaches, the teacher will be able to find similar ways to apply the principle of: “I hear, I forget. I see, I remember. I do, I understand!”
In terms of weekly topics, the course is structured as follows. [Download the full course outline here](/pdfs/iAct-course-outline.pdf).
