# Resources

While originally developed for the NGO-facilitated roll-out (iAct programme), the following resources might be useful for anyone who intends to make use of the iAct course app in one or the other way.

## The iAct Poster

It provides a good overview about the iAct course and the importance and advantages of interactive teaching methods. It is very useful to be placed in resource centres or school admin rooms. 

## The teachers' guide

Basically, the use of the iAct app should be self-explanatory. Still, the teachers' guide gives some background and further details useful for any group which is establishing as an iAct learning team. 

## The facilitators' guide

Within the facilitated programme, Zonal In-service Coordinators get trained by district level trainers. The respective guide which they can take away from that training might be helpful for any government or NGO facilitator who is in charge, to support a number of groups of iAct free users. 

## The trainers' guide

Within the facilitated programme, District Education Board Secretariat as well as NGO district supported get trained. For free users or those who want to encourage the establishment of groups of free users, this document might provide a lot of background as basis for ideas to set up an own roll-out model.
