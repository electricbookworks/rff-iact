12. Enjoy and good luck!


## Method 2 – setting up manually using provided files

[Download the PDF manual](/pdfs/APK-android-manual.pdf) or follow the instructions below

If the videos are in the wrong place, the app can’t show them offline, but will try to stream a video from a server (requires good internet connection). 

The best way to run the app is to have the videos on an SD card, so you should check whether the remaining storage on the SD card is > 7 GB (if not, consider to replace the SD card with a bigger one). Alternatively, you can copy the video files to the device’s internal storage (which also needs to have at least 7 GB remaining 

1. [Click here to download the iAct app in a zip file](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7ploeyhly2bsgtd/AAANJgF06cPTgBun-1SNZbF6a?dl=1) and save it to the main directory (no subfolder!) either of the SD card or of the internal storage of your device.

2. Extract/Unzip the files to a folder to be named `/DCIM/iAct` or to the memory card in a folder to be named `/Videos`.

2. Check whether the folder *Videos* contains all 4+39 iAct videos (never change any names) as well as the application file (*iact.apk*) and the pdf reader (*AdobeReader.apk*).

3. Use a file manager or *Settings/Storage* to select the folder *Videos* and press the iact.apk file to start the installation of the course app.  

4. Before you can finish, you need to go to *Settings* and switch on *Unknown Sources*. On some devices, you have to start the iact.apk again to complete installation. Finish the installation by pressing *Done* (not *Open*).

5. If you don’t have a pdf reader app installed, start the AdobeReader.apk (also in the *Videos* folder), press *Install* and finish installation again with *Done*.  

6. On some devices, *Unknown Sources* are not switched off automatically again and should then be switched off manually (settings). 

7. You can now run the iAct app (assuming that your device has a video app installed). 

8. The app is mostly self-explanatory. However, to be able to do the self-assessments and weekly tests, you need to first register as a user (see *Registration* in the *Introduction* menu). This is only possible, if an administrator with an admin password has entered an “EMIS” number (up to 7 digits, meant to identify the school of a participant). If required, please ask for the admin password: foundation@rogerfederer.com.
