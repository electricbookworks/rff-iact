# Course structure

The iAct course comprises of 20 weekly units spread over four modules, each unit being broken down into individual step-by-step activities. 

After each unit, course participants can take a self-test and repeat it as often as desired in order to assess the extent to which they have mastered the module. Even more importantly, course participants can take short videos from each other when practicing certain methods and discuss the learnings together.

To become eligible for a certificate of attendance, participants send text messages to a central iAct phone number with the codes which the tablet will produce upon registration and doing the self-tests. Learn more about how this assessment and monitoring mechanism works in the downloadable study guide [link].

# Course content

The group-learning exercise facilitated by the iAct app emphasizes key methodologies which will make a difference in the classroom, particularly under difficult circumstances. Once inspired by the learned approaches, the teacher will be able to find similar ways to apply the principle of: “I hear, I forget. I see, I remember. I do, I understand!”
In terms of weekly topics, the course is structured as follows. Download the full course outline here [link to pdf, maybe using a mini-picture].
