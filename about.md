# About iAct

In order to enable the use of tablets or phones in areas where there is no power coverage, the tablets come with a solar powered re-charge kit.

The Roger Federer Foundation's main implementing partner, ROCS, was trained by the iAct technical partner, Saide, on how to roll the course out, manage the course database and provide technical support to iAct course participants and support structures. The strategy used was to utilise existing district and zonal structures of the Ministry of General Education (MoGE) to guide. 

After the initial training of ROCS facilitators, ROCS recruited and trained other implementing NGO partners who worked in several geographic areas, namely DAPP, PAF and Diaconia. 

The NGO partners in turn trained MoGE officials as course facilitators at district and zone level. This entailed the involvement of District Resource Centre Coordinators (DRCCs), District Education Standards Officers (DESOs) as support facilitators, and Zonal In-service Coordinators (ZICs) as frontline facilitators working directly with community school teachers. 

A one-day orientation of teachers in each zone was carried out by ZICs. The orientation involves demonstrations on how to use the tablet, the study guide and role plays on how to work through the course in groups, register for the self-tests and how these would be monitored by course supervisors.

After the orientation, teachers were given the tablet and recharging equipment to take back to their schools and embarked on the course in weekly group activities using the course.
