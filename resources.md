# Resources

While originally developed for the NGO-facilitated roll-out (iAct programme), the following resources might be useful for anyone who intends to make use of the iAct course app in one or the other way.

## The iAct Poster

It provides a good overview about the iAct course and the importance and advantages of interactive teaching methods. It is very useful to be placed in resource centres or school admin rooms. [Download PDF »](/pdfs/iAct-poster.pdf)

## The teachers' guide

Basically, the use of the iAct app should be self-explanatory. Still, the teachers’ guide gives some background and further details useful for any group which is establishing as an iAct learning team. [Download PDF »](/pdfs/iAct-Teacher-Guide.pdf)

## The facilitators' guide

Within the facilitated programme, Zonal In-service Coordinators get trained by district level trainers.
