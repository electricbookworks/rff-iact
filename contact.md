# Partners

iAct is a collaborative effort of several partners. The Roger Federer Foundation has led and funded the development and implementation of the course. The technical design of the course was done in partnership with SAIDE. The lead partner in Zambia, ROCS, is responsible for the coordination of the ground, both in terms of development and implementation. In the 2018/2019 round, co-implementing partners are DAPPS and ZOCS. 

The Roger Federer Foundation supports access to quality education for marginalised and vulnerable children in Switzerland and in six Southern African countries,  namely Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and South Africa. The Foundation works exclusively in partnership with and through local non-governmental organisations. In turn, the local implementing partners work directly with schools, local communities, and national and local governments.
