# Using the iAct app

The iAct course is being rolled out by a few co-implementing partners under the lead of ROCS (see ‘partners’ [link]) to as many community schools in Zambia as possible. A core piece of this facilitation is a district representative who supports the education authorities at district and zonal level, so that the teachers (both volunteers and government-paid) in the targeted community schools receive tablets for the time of the course and are supervised.
However, tablets and smartphones are increasingly common and because the iAct course is an offline app (once it is downloaded to the device), bandwidth and connectivity costs don’t build a barrier to benefitting from the course as free user.

It is all about peer-to-peer learning! Building a group and arranging for regular meetings to jointly work on the weekly units is key. The learning impact of the iAct app basically depends on the intensity of working as a “community of practice”. For instance, really successful learning groups usually take videos from each other when practicing a certain method and then discuss this example in the group.

A typical way to make use of the iAct course would be a teacher in a public primary school, asking a few colleagues to build a learning group over 20 weeks (typically the first and second term) and organize this completely independently.

Another situation might be that a community school was part of the facilitated roll-out the year before, but new teachers (maybe together with some former iAct participants) in that school want to do the course, too. If someone has a tablet or a smartphone, a new round of the iAct course can take place and the zonal in-service coordinator is likely to be able to support, based on the experiences from the previous round.
