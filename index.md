# What is iAct?

iAct stands for "interactive learning and teaching" â€“ methods which can boost a teacher's content knowledge tremendously, resulting in better learner performance and making life in the classroom better both for teachers and pupils. The iAct app leads groups of (pre-)primary teachers through a school-based continuing professional development process. While it was primarily designed for untrained volunteer primary school teachers working in Zambia's community-managed schools, it is a big opportunity for every educator who wants to improve or refresh their methodological skills. 

Because the course is tablet- or phone-based and because the Android app is free to everyone, the only challenge to master is to [download the app and the videos](using-the-iact-app), and find some peers to build a study group.

# Why iAct?

In the 1990s and early 2000s, access to primary education was limited and Zambian citizens started setting up community supported schools that were manned by untrained volunteer teachers. While lack of teacher training is often compensated by intrinsic motivation to a certain extent, many volunteer teachers are not skill in contemporary teaching and learning methodologies that emphasize learning by doing. Even for trained government teachers, this approach has only been promoted by Zambia's new curriculum in 2013. Beyond the Zambian experience, iAct is applicable in any education system that faces similar challenges. [Learn more](about) about the Zambian iAct case study.

###### The iAct app uses a lot of videos. For this reason, it cannot be offered via Google Play, but needs to be installed manually. The phone or tablet to be used for the course should have some internal or SD memory free for the videos, otherwise videos need to be deleted and copied as moving through the course.
