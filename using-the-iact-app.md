# Using the iAct application

A core element in the implementation of iAct is a district representative who supports the education
authorities at district and sub-district level, so that the teachers (both volunteers and government-paid) in the targeted community schools receive tablets for the time of the course and are supervised. However, tablets
and smartphones are increasingly common and because the iAct course, once it is downloaded to the device,
is an offline application, bandwidth and connectivity costs don’t build a barrier to benefitting from the course cost for free.

It is all about peer-to-peer learning! Building a group and arranging for regular meetings to jointly work on the weekly units is key. The learning impact of the iAct application depends on the intensity of working as a
“community of practice”. For instance, really successful learning groups usually take videos from each other
when practicing a certain teaching method or skill and then discuss this example in the group.

A typical way to make use of the iAct course would be a teacher in a school, asking a few colleagues to build a learning group over 20 weeks (typically the first and second term) and organize this completely
independently.

Another situation might be that a community school that was part of the facilitated roll-out the year before,
co-opts new teachers or teachers from a neighbouring non-participating school who want to join the course
for the first time. If someone has a tablet or a smartphone, a new round of the iAct course even supported by
the sub-regional support teams can take place.

# Install instructions

There are two methods of downloading and setting up iAct on an Android device.

You could either download the iAct application on Google Play or manually set up the application using an apk file provided through this website.

In both cases, it is advised to download all videos from this website for offline use. The video files need to be saved either to the path “DCIM/iAct” in the internal storage or to the path “Videos” on the memory card and must not be renamed. Note that about 2GB free storage are needed for the videos. Download the videos [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i09tp2j3fnpmrod/AABNf8yMSuhvreFjRgPrTvrza?dl=1&preview=iAct.zip).

## Method 1 – Setting up via GooglePlay

Download [PDF version for print-out](/pdfs/GooglePlay-android-manual.pdf) or follow the instructions below.

[DOWNLOAD THE APP NOW](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.rff.saide.iact){: .button}

1. If you don’t have the Google Play application on your Android device, download it [here](https://play.google.com/store). Go first to [Gmail](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp) if you do not have a Gmail account, yet.
2. Use your Gmail account username and password to sign into the Google Play Store.
3. Type “iAct” in the search box and enter to search. In case of several hits, choose the app showing the iAct
logo. Note that Google Play Store will not offer the iAct application, if your device is not meeting the
minimum requirements to run this application. In this case, chose the other download method (file for
manual installation).
4. Tap “Install” to start the installation of the app to your phone or tablet. The download progress is shown
for a while and then it will automatically start installing. When installation has finished, tap “Open” to launch the app.
5. A welcome dialogue box will appear. Allow iAct to access photos, media and files on your device by
tapping “Allow”.
6. Then read the dialogue box and make sure you understand the note. If you want to read it again when
starting the app afresh, click “Cancel” to continue. If you don’t want to read this note again, click “Got it”.
7. Don’t forget that the videos should be downloaded from the website. It is very important to save them to
a certain place, either on the internal memory in a folder to be named /DCIM/iAct or to the memory card in
a folder to be named /Videos.
8. This is where you can start the iAct course. Begin by studying the Introduction section, before moving on
to the Modules 1 to 4. The introduction includes a sample unit, which allows you to explore how the course
works.
9. iAct is self-guided, so you will be guided on what to do at every step until you finish the course. If you have any problems along the way, visit the “Help” section below Module 4.
10. The best way to use iAct is in a group of 3-5 teachers. Each of you can register, as described on the
website.
11. Enjoy and good luck!

## Method 2 – setting up manually using provided files

Download [PDF version for print-out](/pdfs/APK-android-manual.pdf) or follow the instructions below.

1. The file iAct.apk is the main application installation file. Download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i09tp2j3fnpmrod/AABNf8yMSuhvreFjRgPrTvrza?dl=1) to save it to your device’s internal storage or memory card.
2. Use a file manager (or on some devices in the settings menu the item “storage/explore”) to find and start
the iAct.apk file. Typically, you have to allow “installation from unknown sources” in the settings of your
device.
3. When installation has finished, tap the iAct icon to start the application.
4. A welcome dialogue box will appear (see to the right). Allow iAct to access photos, media and files on your
device by tapping “Allow”.
5. Then read the dialogue box and make sure you understand the note. If you want to read it again when
starting the app afresh, click “Cancel” to continue. If you don’t want to read this note again, click “Got it”.
6. Don’t forget that the videos should be downloaded from the website. It is very important to save them to
a certain place, either on the internal memory in a folder to be named /DCIM/iAct or to the memory card in
a folder to be named /Videos.
