# Using the iAct application

A core element in the implementation of iAct is a district representative who supports the education authorities at district and sub-district level, so that the teachers (both volunteers and government-paid) in the targeted schools receive tablets for the time of the course and are supervised. However, tablets and smartphones are increasingly common and because the iAct course is an offline application (once it is downloaded to the device), bandwidth and connectivity costs don’t build a barrier to benefitting from the course cost free.

It is all about peer-to-peer learning! Building a group and arranging for regular meetings to jointly work on the weekly units is key. The learning impact of the iAct application depends on the intensity of working as a “community of practice”. For instance, really successful learning groups usually take videos from each other when practicing a certain teaching method or skill and then discuss this example in the group.

A typical way to make use of the iAct course would be a teacher in a school, asking a few colleagues to build a learning group over 20 weeks (typically the first and second term) and organize this completely independently.

Another situation might be that a school that was part of the facilitated roll-out the year before, co-opts new teachers from a neighbouring non-participating school that wants to join the course for the first time. If someone has a tablet or a smartphone in an area of implementation, a new round of the iAct course supported by the sub-regional support teams can take place.

* Whether you are installing the iAct application manually or via the Google Playstore, it is wise to download the videos onto your device so that they are available to use offline/where there is no internet connection. The videos need to be saved as they are without changing their name and they need to be in a folder marked ???? to make sure the iAct application finds them.

## Method 2 – installing iAct manually

[Download the PDF manual](/pdfs/APK-android-manual.pdf) or follow the instructions below

You might have access to the iAct files in a folder which enables you to manually set up iAct on your phone or tablet. You could use a micro SD card or your device internal storage if it is adequate. Start by downloading or copying the iAct files onto your SD card or device. 

The set of files containts 4 files and 39 videos. The file iAct.apk is the main application installation file. Other files are pdfs with instructions. The other is a wallpaper file, the logo and the set-up manual. Do not change any file names for the videos or any other files.

1. If you are using a micro SD card that has the iAct files, insert a micro SD card with the folder which contains all 4 files  and 39 iAct videos as indicated above. If you are using your internal storage, you will find the 4 files and 39 iAct in My Files or where you made a note to copy them to.

2. If you are using a micro SD card, after inserting it into the device, wait a few seconds, then swipe down from the top and look for the notification regarding the SD card. Tap *Set-Up*, select the first option (“use as portable storage”) and confirm with *Next* and *Done*. Swipe down from the top again and press *Clear All* to remove the SD-card notification. In any case, then go to *Settings*, select in the “Device” section *Storage* and *SD-card* (don’t hit “eject SD card).

3. Before you can install, you might need to press Settings and switch on *Unknown Sources* (confirm with OK). It is then that you can now press the iact.apk to install. Finish the installation by pressing *Done* (not *Open*). You do not want to open your application before you have installed the adobe reader that will help you access pdf documents. 

4. Going back to the iAct folder, press the AdobeReader.apk, and select *Install* and finish installation again with *Done*. Finally, swipe down from the top and open *settings* (gear wheel) and in the “Personal” section *Security* and switch off *Unknown Sources*. Tap the *home button* (circle).

5. Swipe down from the top again to open settings and go to *Device* and select *Storage*. Select the *SD-card* and the folder *Videos* (you might need to press the three lines top-left first), press any video to start the video application for a first time. Press somewhere on the video screen to show the context menu (three dots on the top right) and de-select/unselect *loop video*.

6. Finally, start the iAct application. The first steps of launching and setting up your iAct application are the same as the first steps when you install using Google Playstore – (see 1–14 in the section on using Google Playstore above).
